    pests they are discussing. This wastes time, money and hands advantage back to the pests!</p>
    <p>Discovering advice or "information" that solves is the main reason your in this site, Knowledge is the key to developing
      a better understanding of pest activity and good housekeeping can often solve a pest problem just as surely as wise use of pesticides
      will.</p><strong>Here are some images of pests that we offer information on:<strong>

              <h1>Controlling Mosquitoes</h1>

              <p>  As with most insect pests, the best way to control mosquitoes is to get rid of their breeding sites. This means making sure
                that water is not allowed to collect in unwanted equipment and containers which are left lying around.</p>
              <img class="push-left" src="images/mosquito.jpg">
                <p>These containers might include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Car bodies and panels, engine blocks and tyres.</li>
                    <li>Tin cans, plastic containers, drums, lids and jars.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                  <p>Mosquitoes can also breed in:
                    <ul>
                      <li>water which has collected in blocked gutters and drains</li>
                      <li>water tanks, septic tanks and leach drains which do not have lids</li>
                      <li>still areas of water in sewage lagoons</li>
                      <li>pools of water lying under leaking taps</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is important to make sure that there are always lids on water tanks, septic tanks and leach drains and that sewage ponds
                       are kept free of grass and other vegetation around the edges.

For those mosquitoes which do manage to breed somewhere and become a pest in the community, it is important to keep them out of houses.

Putting up flywire on all door openings and windows is a good way of keeping mosquitoes out. Wearing cover-up clothes and using insect repellent on
exposed skin reduces the risk of being bitten when outside
during the biting times. Loose clothes are best because mosquitoes can bite through clothing which is tight against the skin, even jeans. Sleeping
children and babies should be protected with mosquito nets. Insect repellent should never be used on babies – cover them with a net instead.</P>

            <p>Measures to be taken keep cockroaches away from living areas include:
              <ul>
                <li>Keep food in containers which have tightly fitting lids.</li>
                <li>Store food handling equipment and containers up off the floor</li>
                <li>Where possible, fill in small cracks and crevices (holes), in which cockroaches could hide. It is especially important to fill in
                  cracks and crevices around pipes in walls</li>
                <li>Cean shelves and inside and underneath cupboards regularly. This will reduce the build-up of food particles.</li>
                <li>hen required, apply a low toxicity liquid or gel insecticide to those areas where cockroaches may hide, especially cracks and crevices
                  inside and around the outside of buildings, behind stoves and fridges and underneath the shelves of cupboards. There are many suitable
                  insecticides that can be used to effectively control cockroaches. Before insecticides are used, people should be encouraged to regularly
                  clean in and around their houses to reduce the cockroaches’ food source. </li>
