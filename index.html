              <h1>Controlling Mosquitoes</h1>
              <p>As with most insect pests, the best way to control mosquitoes is to get rid of their breeding sites. This means making sure
                that water is not allowed to collect in unwanted equipment and containers which are left lying around.</p>
                <p>These containers might include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Car bodies and panels, engine blocks and tyres.</li>
                    <li>Tin cans, plastic containers, drums, lids and jars.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                  <p>Mosquitoes can also breed in:
                    <ul>
                      <li>water which has collected in blocked gutters and drains</li>
                      <li>water tanks, septic tanks and leach drains which do not have lids</li>
                      <li>still areas of water in sewage lagoons</li>
                      <li>pools of water lying under leaking taps</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is important to make sure that there are always lids on water tanks, septic tanks and leach drains and that sewage ponds
                       are kept free of grass and other vegetation around the edges.

For those mosquitoes which do manage to breed somewhere and become a pest in the community, it is important to keep them out of houses.

Putting up flywire on all door openings and windows is a good way of keeping mosquitoes out. Wearing cover-up clothes and using insect repellent on
exposed skin reduces the risk of being bitten when outside
during the biting times. Loose clothes are best because mosquitoes can bite through clothing which is tight against the skin, even jeans. Sleeping
children and babies should be protected with mosquito nets. Insect repellent should never be used on babies â€“ cover them with a net instead.</P>
